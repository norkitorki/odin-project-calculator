# Odin-Project: Calculator

A basic Calculator build from HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

# Overview Screens/Displays

- The first Screen with a black background and green text atop of the calculator is the "calcDisplay". This will display the results of your evaluations.

- The following white Screen with the distinctively curved edges is the "calcInput" field. This will display your evaluations.

---------------------------------------------

# Overview Keypad Methods

Let's have a look at all the different keys/buttons that you have access to.

- The first <button> at the top left is the "Select" <button>. It gives you the ability to select a specific Evaluation from an Index-Number,which is 
  labeled before each Evaluation in the Calc-Log below the Calculator. If 1 or more Evaluations are present, it will prompt you for an Index-Number to re-
  insert the selected Evaluation and result into its corresponding Displays. The prompt-message will show you the available Index-Numbers,defining an 
  Evaluation you can choose from. If you submit 0 or an Index-Number higher than the available ones, it will return an alert,kindly prompting you to input 
  a valid Index-Number.

- The next <button> to the right of the "Select" <button> is the "Previous" <button>. When you have submitted several evaluations, you will see the Calc-Log
  below the Calculator displaying your previous evaluations in an indexed list. When 2 or more evaluations are present,the "Previous" <button> will re-
  insert the previous evaluation into the "calcDisplay" and "calcInput" for further evaluations from your side.

- To the right is the "Next" <button>. If you have switched back through previous Evaluations and wish to return to an Evaluation one index number up,
  you can click this <button> and the desired evaluation will be returned to the CalcDisplay and CalcLog. 

  Please Note! If no evaluation is present in the Calc-Log and you click the "Previous" or "Next" <button> , the "calcDisplay" will throw an 
  "No Evaluations found" Error Message.

- The last <button> on the first row is the "RESET" <button>. This button will reset both the "calcDisplay" and "calcInput" to its original state as they
  were on pageload. PLEASE NOTE! Clicking the "RESET" <button> will only reset the Displays, it will not reset your previous Evaluations in the Calc-Log.

- Moving down a row. The next <button> on the left hand side is the "pow" <button>. If a number is present in the "calcInput" field, this button will
  add the given number as base and prompt you for an exponent(essentially the Math.pow(x, y) method,where x is the base and y is the exponent).
  The result will be displayed in the "calcInput" field, for further evaluation. If no number is present or the "calcInput" is empty, clicking this 
  <button> will kindly prompt you to input a number into the "calcInput" field and return.

- Next up is the SquareRoot("sqrt") <button>. When this button is clicked, it will evaluate the Square-Root of the number present 
  in the "calcInput" and present you with the result in the "calcInput" field. If the "calcInput" prior to clicking the "sqrt" <button> is empty or no
  number is present, then the "calcDisplay" will kindly ask you to insert a number.

- To the right, you will find the "<=" backspace <button>. Clicking this <button> will work in the same way as the "Backspace" key on your keyboard.
  It will remove the last digit in the "calcInput" field.
  If you're not much a fan of clicking buttons, you also have the ability to press the "Backspace" key on your keyboard.

- At the bottom left is the "Result" <button>. When this button is clicked,it will insert the result visible in the "calcDisplay" back
  into the "calcInput" field for further evaluation. However,please notice that if the contents of the "calcDisplay" should not be a number,it will not 
  insert these contents back into the "calcInput" field.

# Overview Keypad Mathematical Operations

Division ( "/" ) : The "/" <button> will divide the divisor with the dividend to find the quotient. Example : 24 / 12 = 2.

Multiplication ( "x" ) : The "x" <button> will multiply the multiplicand with the multiplier. Example : 2 x 8.

Subtraction ( "-" ) : The "-" <button> will subtract the minuend with the subtrahend to find the difference. Example : 10 - 4 = 6.

Addition ( "+" ) : The "+" <button> will add the addend with the summand to find the sum. Example : 14 + 3 = 17.

Equal Sign ( "=" ) : The "=" <button> will run the mathematical evaluation present in the "calcInput" and return the result to the "calcDisplay".
	             As an alternative to pressing the "=" <button>, you can also press the "Enter" on your keyboard
 		     If the evaluation present in the "calcInput" is not possible to evaluate, it will return "NaN".

---------------------------------------------
			
# Overview Keypad Number Inputs

To insert numbers or operators into the "calcInput" for evaluation, you have two options.

You can either use your Keyboard number keys or you can use your mouse to click the corresponding numbers on the keypad. 

The "." <button> will insert a decimal seperator into the "calcInput" field.

---------------------------------------------

# Overview Keyboard Shortcuts

Press the "/" key to insert the Division operator into the Calculator Input.

Press the "x" or "*" key to insert the Multiplication operator into the Calculator Input.

Press the "-" key to insert the subtraction operator into the Calculator Input.

Press the "+" key to insert the addition operator into the Calculator Input.

Press the "." (Period) key to insert a decimal seperator into the Calculator Input. 

Press the "Backspace" key to remove the last character in the Calculator Input.

Press the "Enter" key to run the mathematical evaluation and return the result.

Press the "P" key to loop down the Calculator Log indexes and re-insert the evaluations into the corresponding displays.

Press the "N" key to loop ipwards the Calculator Log indexes and re-insert the evaluations into the corresponding displays.

Press the "R" key to run the reset function and reset the Calculator displays.

Press the "C" key to clear the Calculator Log.

---------------------------------------------

# Overview Calculator Log 

The Calculator Log beneath the Calculator will appear when you have successfully evaluated at least one evaluation.
The Log Entries are labeled with Index Numbers in front of their evaluations,so that you can easily choose a previous one for further evaluation should
you so desire,as described in the "Previous","Next" and "Select" <button> chapters above.

If you wish to clear all the entries from the Calculator Log, you can click on the "Clear Log" <button> atop of the indexed Entries.
